# Introduction

This repository stores custom ComfyUI nodes that I created to solve various needs while working with ComfyUI.  
These nodes are primarily designed for my own workflow using **Qwen-Image**, **Z-Image Trubo**, **Flux**, and **WAN**.  
Using them with other models may cause unexpected issues.

++ComfyUI-DINKIssTyle_CPH**(Cross-Platform Helper) performs the following tasks every time ComfyUI starts:
1. Fixes issues with Korean filenames uploaded from macOS to Windows.
2. Removes macOS resource forks that appear when files uploaded from macOS are used on Windows.
